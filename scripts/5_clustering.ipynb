These areas are marked by deep socioeconomic challenges, including widespread child poverty, high unemployment, and elevated levels of food insecurity and income inequality. Residents in these counties typically experience the lowest median incomes and severely limited access to healthcare services. This cluster reflects communities in urgent need of targeted support and policy intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "üü© Green Cluster ‚Äì Prosperous & Well-Served\n",
    "The Green Cluster represents high-performing counties across the United States. These areas stand out for their strong socioeconomic and health profiles, with notably high median incomes, excellent healthcare access, and widespread exercise opportunities. Additionally, they exhibit low rates of food insecurity, child poverty, and uninsured individuals. Overall, this cluster reflects well-resourced communities with strong infrastructure and access to essential services‚Äîmaking them clear leaders in terms of community well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "üüß Orange Cluster ‚Äì Underinsured but Not Poor\n",
    "The Orange Cluster includes counties where residents may not be economically deprived but still face serious gaps in healthcare access. These areas are defined by high uninsured rates and below-average healthcare access, despite having relatively modest income levels. The population may include working individuals without employer-sponsored insurance, possibly reflecting communities with large informal labor sectors or high immigrant populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "üü£ Purple Cluster ‚Äì Working-Age Unstable\n",
    "The Purple Cluster is made up of counties with a mixed profile. While not facing the extremes seen in the Red Cluster, these areas still struggle with pockets of economic instability. They tend to have higher-than-average unemployment and moderately low income levels. These communities may represent younger or more diverse working-class populations navigating financial uncertainty, with uneven access to resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîµ Blue Cluster ‚Äì Balanced, Slightly Struggling\n",
    "The Blue Cluster captures counties that fall near the average across most indicators. These areas show slightly lower income levels and healthcare access, but don‚Äôt display severe disadvantages. They may represent transitional or mid-tier communities‚Äîneither thriving nor in crisis‚Äîmaking them a useful reference point for evaluating broader trends.\n"

    "#### Conclusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis using both supervised regression and unsupervised K-means clustering, the findings suggest meaningful patterns in the relationship between key socioeconomic factors and healthcare access across U.S. counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to strengthen the validity of the patterns observed through unsupervised machine learning, additional statistical methods may be necessary. While the current results suggest a weak to moderate positive relationship between key variables and healthcare access, further testing could help raise the confidence level in the alternative hypothesis and potentially reveal a strong positive relationship. Incorporating additional predictors‚Äîsuch as educational attainment, healthcare provider density, or regional policy factors‚Äîcould also enhance the model's explanatory power and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the determinants of healthcare access.\n",
