# healthcare-access-us

## üè• Introduction

This project uses a multivariate approach to explore healthcare access across more than 3,000 U.S. counties. By combining socioeconomic and environmental indicators such as median income, food insecurity, insurance coverage, and exercise access, a unified Healthcare Access Score was developed to assess disparities in care availability.

The analysis covers 2020‚Äì2024 and forms part of a broader portfolio exploring regional well-being across the United States. Key outputs include composite scoring, regression modeling, clustering, and interactive Tableau visualizations.
